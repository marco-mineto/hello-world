# hello-world

Hi,
My name is Marco Antonio Mineto Gasque Mendonca. I am a network engineer who is working torwards CCIE Enterprise, previously called CCIE Routing and Switching.
Beside the path of achieving the CCIE, I am also learning a lot about programming, something that I was never been fan of, but the more I learn, the more I get interested on that.
I know I will achieve my CCIE, but the most important for me is the journey to get there. I am learning more and more each day and I am getting interested in the subjects as deeper I go on those.
